There are some errors Eclipse throws when dealing with some of the JavaFX classes
used in Drill07 (see 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22812488/using-javafx-in-jre-8-access-restriction-error
for more info).  To deal with these, download e(fx)clipse.
 * in eclipse, Help —> Install New Software
 * In “Work with” drop down menu select Photon
 * In “filter text” field type “e(fx)clipse"
 * Click the select box next to e(fx)clipse IDE
 * Click next and follow the rest of the instructions from install wizard
 * on bottom right of eclipse IDE, keep track of the installation progress
 * You will need to restart Eclipse for the changes to take effect
