# Drill03 (Posted: Sept 9, 2018 5 pm)

For this Drill, you will be implementing methods in the Shape, Triangle, and Square
classes.  The goal is to practice some with polymorphism and implementing classes.

Action Items
 * Copy the starter code in Shape.Java, Triangle.java, Square.java, and 
 Drill03TestClass.java into your local CS210DrillsProject.  Visit the Drills-Public
 repository at https://github.com/UACS210Fall2018/Drills-Public and copy and
 post the code from those files into files of the same name in your Eclipse
 project under the edu.uacs210fall2019.drill03 subdirectory.
 
 * Look in Drill03TestClass.java to see how the various classes are being constructed,
 what methods are being called on them, and what the expected result should be.
 Implement the methods in the classes so that all of the test cases pass.
 
 * SUBMIT the Shape.java, Square.java, and Triangle.java files to the gradescope 
 Drill03 assignment.
