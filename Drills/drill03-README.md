# Drill03

For this Drill, you will be implementing methods in the Shape, Triangle, and Square
classes.  The goal is to practice some with polymorphism and implementing classes.

Action Items
 * Copy the starter code in Shape.Java, Triangle.java, Square.java, and 
 Drill03TestClass.java into your local CS210DrillsProject. Do this exactly
 like you did for drill02. Instructions can be found on the piazza->resources
 page.
 
 * Look in Drill03TestClass.java to see how the various classes are being constructed,
 what methods are being called on them, and what the expected result should be.
 Implement the methods in the classes so that all of the test cases pass.
 
 * SUBMIT the Shape.java, Square.java, and Triangle.java files to the gradescope 
 Drill03 assignment.
