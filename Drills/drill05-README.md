# Drill05

This drill has you doing 5 tasks that are relevant for PA6.  Go to
Piazza to find the relevant files. Create a new package like you have done for
previous drills. Instructions can be found on piazza. Note that we will be going
through some of the important material for this drill on Tuesday. I apologize for
that.

Then implement the following methods in Drill05.java.

## getShapeFromGrid

Given a list of lists of Shapes organized in a grid and a row and column,
return the shape in the given location.

## isTriangle

Return true if the shape in the given location is a Triangle and false otherwise.

## isSquare

Return true if the shape in the given location is a Square and false otherwise.


## byRow

Concatenate all of the Strings in the grid by going row by row.  If a row
or row and column location is null, then just concatenate in an empty string.

## setArrayElem

Set the given row and column in the given screen to the given character.
