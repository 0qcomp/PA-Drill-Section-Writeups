# Drill06

This drill has you doing 5 tasks that help you practice working with generics,
which will be helpful for PA7.  Go to the piazza resources section to download
the drill06 code and create a new package for it the same as previous drills.

Then implement the following methods in Drill06.java.

## returnValue

Given a generic HashNode<K,V> as a parameter return the value in the HashNode.

## returnKey

Given a generic HashNode<K,V> as a parameter return the key in the HashNode.

## findLastVal

In the singly-linked list of generic HashNode<K,V>s that starts with the
given node, return the value in the last node.

## findNodeByIndex

In the singly-linked list of generic HashNode<K,V>s that starts with the
given node, return the indexed node.  The first node is index 0, then next
index 1, etc.

## countNodes

Count all of the nodes in the given singly-linked list of generic HashNode<K,V>s
that starts with the given node.
