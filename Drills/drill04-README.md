# Drill04

This drill has you doing 5 tasks that are relevant for PA4.  Go to the 
https://github.com/UACS210Fall2018/Drills-Public repository online and
copy the following into your local Drill project.
 * src/bool_expr/*
 * src/edu/uacs210fall2018/drill04/*

Then implement the following methods in Drill04.java.

## splitWrapper

Separate fields by commas. Have empty strings if there is nothing between
commas or after last comma and end of line.
This will require reading documentation on split.

## enum2string

This can be implemented with one, short line of code!
Read some documentation about enumerated types to figure out how
to get a string for a Java enumerated type.

## getLexeme

Return the string representation for the given token in
the given string.  Use the Lexer that we provide for PA4.
Copy the bool_expr/\* files into your Drills src/ subdirectory.

## sumTree

Return the sum of all the data on the given tree.  Copy the TreeNode.java
file from Drills-Public that is in the drill04 subdirectory.

## createConfigStr

Create a configuration string like what is needed for PA4 based on
given map.  See Drill04TestClass.java for the format of the expected output.
