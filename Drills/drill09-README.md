# Drill09

This drill has you doing 4 tasks that help you practice working with lambda functions.  
Go to the 
https://github.com/UACS210Fall2018/Drills-Public repository online and
copy the following into your local Drill project.

 * src/edu/uacs210fall2018/drill09/*

Then implement the following methods in Drill09.java.

## returnAddTwoLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes an integer as input and 
returns that integer plus 2.

## returnConcatToHelloLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes a String as input and 
returns that String concatenated to the "hello" string.

## returnAvgWithThreeLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes an integer as input and 
returns that integer averaged with 3.

## returnConcatWith1n2ListLambda

This function should return a lambda function that takes a List<Integer> as input and 
returns a List with the numbers 1 and 2 and then the given list concatenated afterwards.
