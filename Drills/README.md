## Drills for Fall 2018

Computer Science is the art of solving problems with computers.  The main mechanism
we use to solve problems with a computer is programming.
This semester, you will be learning and practicing the skill of programming in Java.
For the last couple of decades, Java has been the first or second most popular
programming language (https://fossbytes.com/most-popular-programming-languages/).
Thus there are many tools that have been developed to ease programming and development
in Java.

Programming is a skill
that like all other skills require practice to learn and improve.  In CS 210 this
Fall 2018, you will be doing programming drills that are due each Friday.  These
drills provide you an opportunity to learn and practice the basic syntax and semantics
of Java and how to use Java to solve and test solutions for the kinds of problems
that will appear in the larger programming assignments.

### Getting Started with Drills

Let's start by having you create your own private drill repository on github,
which you will be using all semester.  No one but you and the CS 210 staff
can see the code in your private drill repository.

 * Each student will create their own drill repository by accepting the
   drill assignment at [FIXME].  ALL of your drills should be committed
   and pushed to your drill github repository to enable the CS 210 staff
   to help you with any questions or issues you are having remotely.
   (ONE TIME SETUP)
   
 * In Eclipse (see [FIXME] to set up Eclipse), import the drill repository.
 
 *
   [Talk some about the drill organization.]
   In the src/edu/uacs210fall2018/drill##/ directories, there will be
a Drill##.java file (and later other files) that you will be editing.
   (ONE TIME SETUP)

### Doing a Drill

Doing a drill consists of (1) downloading the files for the drill,
(2) adding those files to your drill repository, (3) writing code
to solve one drill problem at a time, (3) test each drill problem
solution in Eclipse using JUnit, and (4) submitting the solution
to the appropriate drill assignment in Gradescope.



* For each drill assignment, there will be 
You just put the files for Drill01 into your repository
   on your machine and if you did a commit and push a copy is also in your
   repository on github.
the Drill##TestClass.java,
Drill##.java, and any other needed files


Give it a try!  In the Eclipse Package Explorer, right click
   on the CS210-Drills/src/edu/uacs210fall2018/drill01/Drill01TestClass.java 
   file and select "Run As" --> "JUnit Test".
   One of the test cases will pass, but the rest are broken right now.
   Your job is to fix them by editing the corresponding Drill01.java file.
   The drill is complete when all of the test cases pass.
 



The purpose of this exercise is show you how drills will work this semester.




You will then import the drill repository into Eclipse.  [FIXME: more needed]



Running the test cases in Eclipse.  [FIXME]  Run the test cases right
away.  Some might actually pass, but most should fail initially.

Work on one method implementation at a time.
For the drills, you will be given simple Java methods and (and later classes) 
to implement.  A method is a small block of code that takes some inputs and 
returns an output - a lot like a function from Python.  Your job is to write 
a small amount of Java code that will produce the correct result for any
valid inputs.

Submit to gradescope as many times as you would like.  Gradescope
will autograde your drill and tell you your grade for each drill.
Each drill will indicate at the top of the drill##-README.md file
exactly what file(s) need to be submitted to gradescope for that
drill.  There are no hidden test cases for drills.  You can test
all of your drill method implementations in Eclipse before uploading
your file(s) to Gradescope.  Feel free to submit partially done drills
to check on your progress (and provide yourself at least some partial
credit if you forget to finish the drill).


Each drill includes a description page, see 
src/edu/uacs210fall2018/drill01/drill01-README.md for an example.
The README file will describe the purpose of the exercise, what the 
inputs are, and what the return value ought to be.  You will write your
code in the Drill##.java file.  Each exercise comes with "skeleton code" 
- that is, the basic mechanics of the method.  Your job is to fill in 
the part in the middle marked with a TODO.
