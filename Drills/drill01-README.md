# Drill01

For listContains() and setContains() You can use any of the methods in the Set interface 
or iterate through the set and check each value.  We recommend you try both to practice iterating through
lists and sets.

## createArray

This drill provides experience with constructing and initializing all of the elements in and array.

Description:
Construct and initialize an array with size elements and return the array. my_array[i] should 
hold the value val*i.

## listContains

Practice iterating over a list.

Description:
Return true if the given list contains the given value val and return false otherwise.

## setContains

Practice iterating over a set.  There is another way to implement this as well.
Experiment with both!

Description: 
Return whether the given set contains the given value, and return false otherwise.

## countCategories

Practice placing key,value pairs in a map, where it is necessary to look up whether
that key has been placed in the map already.

Description:
Given a list of categories (represented as string), return a Map with the category
being the key and the number of times that category appears being the value.

## numPositions

Practice looking up information in nested maps.

Description:
Given a mapping of categories to a map of locations to a count of how many of that
category are at each location, return the number of positions for the given location and
category. Return 0 if the given location and category combination are not in the data.
