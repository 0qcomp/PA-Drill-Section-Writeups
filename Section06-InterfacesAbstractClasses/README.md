# Section06-InterfacesAbstractClasses

## Section Objectives
This sections goal is to allow practice in recognizing the differences between abstract classes and interfaces, as well as the process of analyzing code to create an abstract class or interface.

## Setup
Click on the green "Clone or download" button on the right of the web page and copy the provided URL.

Import your section repository into Eclipse.

Open Eclipse File —> Import —> Git —> Projects from Git, Next, Clone URI, Next, paste in repository URL from github Next, Select the master branch, Next, make the local destination /home/username/eclipse-workspace/Section06-InterfacesAbstractClasses-yourgithubid. Next, Import existing Eclipse projects, Next, Finish. Now you are ready for the section activity.

## Abstract Class Interface Mystery
Within this repository, there are a series of files which represent cars. Your task is to look over these files, and discuss in pairs whether an abstract class or an interface would be more applicable to encapsulating the details within these classes. In this discussion, be sure you are able to fully explain why you selected the option that you did, through the process of discussing what each would encapsulate from the provided class files. 

After you have done an analysis of which should be used, create the class or interface you thought would be the best fit with the components you identified in your discussion. 

Once you have created an interface or abstract class that meets the requirements of encapsulating the other classes, modify the given classes so they utilize the abstract class or interface you created. This interface or class should be called car.
